# (AVM) Confidence Level

## What is FSD
FSD is a statistical measure that represents the probability that the Automated Valuation Model (AVM) value falls within a statistical range of the actual market value, measured against a sales price.
Example: If the FSD for an HVE value estimate is 10%, there is a 68% (one standard deviation) probability that the actual market value will fall between +/-10% of the HVE value estimate.
FSD is expressed as a percentage in decimal form i.e., 13% as .13.
The lower the FSD, the smaller the error in predicting actual market value.
FSD is included in your HVE report and can be used to determine your own internal confidence bands.

## FSD correlates with the HVE Confidence Level
HVE's Confidence Levels are derived from the FSD and are summarized within high, medium, and low value ranges.
High: <.130 FSD (approximately 70% of HVE value estimates)
Medium: > .131 and <.200 FSD (approximately 25% of HVE value estimates)
Low: > .201 FSD (approximately 5% of HVE value estimates)
